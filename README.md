GROUPS 
<hr>
OVER 50'S 

Research suggest that many over 50's are lonely and often feel isolated from the world, this website wants to tackle that thorugh social walks. The end goal for support this group is to encourage new friendships and physical activity. Each walk for this group is carefully considered so that socialising is at the forefront of our thoughts, to ensure that this is acheived we ensure that each walk has an opportunity to stop for a cup of tea or a slaice of cake to allow the opportunity to talk.

MENTAL HEALTH 

Mental illness has dramatically increased in people of all ages thoughout 2020 and this demonstrates how vulnerable peoples mental health is. Increasing your physical activity whilst having a chat with people who may be struggling in the same way can help for better mental health. This group walk is designed to tackle both.

LEARNING//PHYSICAL DIFFICULTIES

Individuals who suffer from learning or phyical difficulties often do not not have access to to suuport in getting out and about and care home and support groups are often overwelmed with finding activities to do to support their physical wellbeing. This walking group is designed to take the strain from that and offer a place to go to support physical activity. Each walk is mindful or terrain and duration to support this groups needs.

FAMILIES 

This walking group is targeted towards families in order to offer something to do with the kids that increases their physical wellbeing whilst being free. As more families struggle with their finances and have to compromise on days out with the family, this walk offers a place to take the kids and meet other families whilst exploring and learning about our countryside.
