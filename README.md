>### *Over 50's*

Research suggest that many over 50's are lonely and often feel isolated from the world. This website wants to tackle that through social walks. The end goal for this group is to encourage new friendships and physical activity. Each walk for this group is carefully considered so that socialising is at the forefront of our thoughts, to ensure that this is acheived we ensure that each walk has an opportunity to stop for a cup of tea or a slice of cake to allow the opportunity to talk.

>### *Mental Health*

Mental illness has dramatically increased in people of all ages thoughout 2020, demonstrating how vulnerable people's mental health can be. Increasing your physical activity has been proven to be effective in supporting better mental health. This walking group hopes to provide an environment for people to talk about their mental health with like minded people, whilst getting vital physical activity. This group walk is designed to tackle both.

>### *Learning/Physical difficulties*

Individuals who suffer from learning or phyical difficulties often do not not have access to support in getting vital physical activity. Care homes and support groups are often overwelmed. Finding activities to do that support physical wellbeing can be hard. This walking group is designed to offer an option for individuals and groups that suffer from learning or physical difficulties to get vital physical activity. Each walk is mindful of terrain and duration to support this groups needs.
